MediaTagi Implementation Choices
================================

MediaTagi canonical source is hosted at GitHub (obviously).

MediaTagi integrates well with MediaWiki, expecting a MediaWiki to be the parallel reference wiki. (Or is there a Python wiki that would be an better choice?)

MediaTagi is implemented in Python + Django (+ Pinax?), backed by a MySQL database.
